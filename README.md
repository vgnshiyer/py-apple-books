Annotations:
        Adversity shaped me
        The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

        They’re always trying to save the world, with their underpants on the outside or these skin-tight iron suits, which is really pretty strange when you think about it,
        Reading remained Musk’s psychological retreat. Sometimes he would immerse himself in books all afternoon and most of the night, nine hours at a stretch. When the family went to someone’s house, he would disappear into their host’s library. When they went into town, he would wander off and later be found at a bookstore, sitting on the floor, in his own world.
        Elon developed into a night person, staying up until dawn reading books
        One unfortunate trend in the 1980s was that cars and computers became tightly sealed appliances. It was possible to open up and fiddle with the innards of the Apple II that Steve Wozniak designed in the late 1970s, but you couldn’t do that with the Macintosh, which Steve Jobs in 1984 made almost impossible to open.

#### Get a list of collections along with books

```python
collections = api.list_collections(include_books=True)
for collection in collections:
    print('-'*50)

    for book in collection.books:
        print(f"\t{book.title}")
```

```
# Sample output

    print(f'Note text: {note.note}')
```

```
# sample output
--------------------------------------------------
Selected text: profusion
Note text: Plethora
--------------------------------------------------
Selected text: As multi-leader replication is a somewhat retrofitted feature in many databases, there are often
subtle configuration pitfalls and surprising interactions with other database features. For example,
autoincrementing keys, triggers, and integrity constraints can be problematic. For this reason,
multi-leader replication is often considered dangerous territory that should be avoided if possible
Note text: Retrofitted = add on
--------------------------------------------------
Selected text: By subtracting a follower’s current position from the leader’s
current position, you can measure the amount of replication lag.
Note text: Calculate lag for leader based replication.
```

#### Find all green highlights

```python
notes = api.get_annotation_by_color('green')
for note in notes:
    print('-'*50)
    print(f'Selected text: {note.selected_text}')
    print(f'Color: {note.color}')
```

```
# sample output
--------------------------------------------------
Selected text: The purpose of life is a life of purpose
Color: green
--------------------------------------------------
Selected text: No man is free who is not a master of himself.'
